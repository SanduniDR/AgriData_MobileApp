# Ceylon AgriData

**Project Name:** Enhancing Productivity in Sri Lanka’s Agriculture Sector with a Cloud-Based System for Data Acquisition and Representation to Facilitate Informed Decision Making  

**Course:** Individual Project for Master of Information Technology  

**Institution:** University of Colombo School of Computing  

## Overview

**Ceylon AgriData** is a cloud-based system designed to enhance Sri Lanka's agricultural productivity by transitioning from paper-based data collection to a digital platform. The system features:

- A **mobile app** for agricultural officers, facilitating streamlined data collection directly from the field, thereby improving data accuracy and accessibility.
- A **web application** providing user-friendly dashboards for data visualization, enabling informed decision-making and policy development.
- A **report generation tool** for creating detailed reports from aggregated agricultural data to facilitate operations.
- A **message broadcasting service** for timely dissemination of important information among stakeholders.
- A **free advertising service** that allows farmers to market their products directly, improving sales opportunities and supporting government price regulation efforts.
- A **REST API** for seamless communication between the mobile app and web application.

Built using **Python, Flask, React,** and **Flutter**, Ceylon AgriData utilizes a service-oriented multi-tier architecture to manage agricultural data effectively.

### Key Technologies
- **Mobile App:** Flutter framework with Dart
- **Web App:** React.js with JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python Flask REST API
- **Database:** MySQL (production), SQLite (development)

## Repository Contents
- **frontend/:** AgriData-FE - Contains the source code for the React.js web application.
- **backend/:** AgriData-BE - Contains the Python Flask backend with the necessary API endpoints and database connection settings.
- **mobile_app/:** AgriData_MobileApp - Contains the source code for the Flutter-based mobile application.

## Implementation Methodology
The **Ceylon AgriData** system follows a service-oriented multi-tier architecture:
- **Presentation Layer:** Mobile application (Flutter) and web application (React).
- **Application Logic Layer:** REST API developed using Python Flask.
- **Data Layer:** MySQL database for production, SQLite for initial development.
